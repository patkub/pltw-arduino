| Accelerometer Motor          | Use an accelerometer to drive a motor.                                                |
| Accelerometer Position       | Display position and acceleration of an accelerometer.                                |
| Alternate Blink              | Alternates between two LEDs every second.                                             |
| Blink                        | Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.               |
| Count Down to Graduation     | LCD count down to graduation displayed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.          |
| Micro Servo Pot              | Control a servo motor using a potentiometer with accurate positioning.                |
| Morra Game                   | Play against the computer by throwing hands and guessing the total number of fingers. |
| Push Button                  | Reads a VEX bumber switch (or pushbutton) and turns on an LED.                        |
| Servo Potentiometer          | Control a servo motor using a potentiometer.                                          |
| Two Axis Accelerometer       | Reads input from a Memsic 2125 two-axis accelerometer.                                |
